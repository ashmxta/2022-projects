# 2022-projects
This section contains my first programming projects in 2022. 
I had some prior exposure to programming in middle school, creating simple games and coding in blocks with scratch. Afterwards in high school, I learnt some html to build simple websites. I started properly programming when I was 17, through U of T's summer engineering preparation program. In this repository, find the projects and code written in my first semester of Engineering at U of T.
